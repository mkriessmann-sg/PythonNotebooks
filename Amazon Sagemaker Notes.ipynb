    "Takes over the complicated part of managing a machine learning enviroment.\n",
    "Allows you to load data (primarily optimised for AWS products) from databases.\n",
    "Raw data sometimes has to be combined or related into so called \"features\". Creating such features can take a long time, so SageMaker has features to take over or assist in this process.\n",

    "Instance types just describe what kind of instance you want to instantiate to use for your notebook. This affects the processing power, memory and storage space.\n",
